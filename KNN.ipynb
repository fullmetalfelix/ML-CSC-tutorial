    "In a classification problem, each input $\\mathbf{x}$ has a corresponding class label, $c^n \\in \\{1, \\cdots, C \\}$. \n",
    "Given a data set of $N$ training examples, $D=\\{\\mathbf{x}^n, c^n \\}, n=1, \\cdots, N$ and new test data $\\mathbf{x}_t$, the goal is predict the correct class $c_t(\\mathbf{x}_t)$.\n",

    "K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is commonly used for a classification algorithm. \n",
    "The Figure below presents an example of KNN classification.\n",
    "The test data point (green circle) can be classified either to the first class (blue squares) or to the second class (red triangles). If we use Nearest Neighbor algorithm, the test data point is assigned to be in the second class, because it has the closest distance to a red triangle.\n",
    "In KNN, $K$ is an extra paramater to be determined, that is the number of the nearest neigbor.\n",
    "If we select $K = 3$ (solid line circle), the test data is assigned to the second class because there are two red triangles and only one blue square inside the inner circle. However, if we select $K = 5$ (dashed line circle), the test data is assigned to the first class (three squares vs. two triangles inside the outer circle).\n",
