    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is typically used to transform a high-dimensional data set into a smaller-dimensional subspace prior to applying a machine learning algorithm on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{x^i} = \\left[ x_1^i, x_2^i, \\cdots, x_M^i \\right]$ be a M-dimensional vector describing the $i$-th sample. The entire dataset of $N$ samples can be expressed as a $N \\times M$ matrix $X$, whose rows are the samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "X &= \\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "x_1^1 & x_2^1  & \\ldots & x_M^1  \\\\\n",
    "x_1^2 & x_2^2  & \\ldots & x_M^2  \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "x_1^N & x_2^N  & \\ldots & x_M^N\n",
    "\\end{array} \\right) \n",

    "PCA aims to transform the original data in order to maximise its variance. In practice, the new representation of the data $Y$ is linearly related to the original one:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "Y = X \\cdot V\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns of $V$, $\\{ \\mathbf{v}_1, \\cdots , \\mathbf{v}_M \\}$ are the principal components (PCs) of $X$, and correspond to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of $X$, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{cov} (X)= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_n^{N} (x_n - \\mu_x) \\, (x_n - \\mu_x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix, $\\text{cov} (X)$, describes all relationships between pairs of measurements in our dataset $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the covariance matrix is symmetric, the eigenvectors form an orthogonal set. The PCs (eigenvectors) correspond to the direction (in the original n-dimensional space) with the greatest variance in the data. Each eigenvector has a corresponding eigenvalue, indicating how much variance there is in the data along the corresponding eigenvector (or PC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensionality reduction can be performed by removing the PCs with the lowest eigenvalues, thus throwing away redundant features with low information content.\n"
