    "# Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "GA is a simple optimisation algorithm that mimics evolution. It starts with a random population of elements, and evaluates how <i>fit for survival</i> they are. Elements are then randomly selected in pairs to mate and produce a new generation of offspring. The selection ensures that elements with higher fitness are more likely to be chosen for mating, thus increasing the chances that their offspring retains the characteristics that made their parents fit in the first place. Random mutation can also appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an optimisation problem is too complex to be solved via gradient methods, GA can still give an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to use GA to find a set of parameters that fit a signal.<br>\n",
