    "# Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a **local** descriptor, that maps the local environment around a point very accurately. It eliminates rotational, and permutation redundancies by integrating the overlap of smoothed out atomic positions, by gaussian smearing, and mapping them into coefficients of orthornormal basis functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smooth out the atomic positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The atomic positions are point objects in space. Integrating them would need a lot of basis functions. Thus, the atoms' positions are smeared as gaussian functions. \n",
    "    $$ \\rho(r) = \\sum_i e^{-(r-r_i)^2}$$\n",
    "    However, this also makes all the elements indistinguishable. Thus, SOAP for individual elements, in molecule/unit-cell, is calculated, and then the values are concantenated at end. \n",

    "    The obtained smeared atomic position, or atomic density, if you will, is decomposed using Laplace Spherical Harmonics -- spherical harmonics in real space -- and orthogonal basis set: $\\Upsilon_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)$ and  $g_n(r) $. \n",
